Voice detection to google search algorithm (Alex)

Using a microphone input, the program takes in what the user says and searches it up on google, providing proper feedback based on the google search serpAPI.
There are multiple different types of outputs from google, but this starter program just looks for an output box. Other branches of the repository look into other types of search scraping but were not fully developed.
